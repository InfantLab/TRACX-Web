[explanation]
ref = "(p.621, French et al., 2011)"
text = "We started with the stimuli from the seminal experiment (Saffran et al., 1996) on infant word extraction. This was the first article to emphasize the importance of TPs in word segmentation of a continuous sound stream. Infants heard a continuous stream of words for 2 min in a technique developed by Jusczyk and Aslin (1995). Six different words were constructed, each composed of three distinct syllables drawn from an alphabet of 12 syllables. A sequence consisting of 90 of these words (270 syllables), randomly selected and with no immediate repeats or pauses between words, was presented twice to 8-month-olds. The infants were then tested to determine whether they were able to discriminate between the words of the language and the partwords consisting of the final syllable from one word and the first two syllables of another word. The forward TPs were higher for syllable pairs within words than for syllable pairs making up partwords. After infants listened to the familiarization sequence, their attention was drawn to a speaker by a flashing red light. Words (or partwords) from the familiarization sequence were repeatedly broadcast from the speaker, and the amount of time that the infant continued to look at the speaker was measured. Infants looked at the speaker significantly longer when they heard partwords, compared with words."
