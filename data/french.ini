[explanation]
ref = "(p.627, French et al., 2011)"
text = "We designed an experiment in which we controlled for forward transition probabilities and, at the same time, ensured that all words (i.e., A-words, B-words, and C-words) in the familiarization sequence had the same frequency of occurrence. There are three word blocks: A, B, and C. Between syllables within a word, the TPs are all .5. So, p(a2 | a1) = .5, p(a3 | a1) = .5, p(b2 | b1) = .5, p(b3 | b1) = .5, p(c2 | c1) = .5, p(c3 | c1) = .5. The TPs between words are also .5. Thus, p(A | B) = .5, p(B | C) = .5, p(C | A) = .5, and so on. This means that every A-word, say, a1a2, can be followed by either a B-word or a C-word, with equal probability. So, a1a2 can be followed by b1b2, b1b3, c1c2, or c1c3. In other words, a1a2 will be followed half the time by b1 and half the time by c1. Thus, the word a1a2 will occur twice as often as the partwords a2b1 and a2c1. This means that forward TPs are identical for all the syllable pairs, but word frequencies (i.e., frequencies of A-words, B-words, and C-words) are twice partword frequencies. This construction implies that backward TPs within words (=1) are higher than those between words (=.25)."
