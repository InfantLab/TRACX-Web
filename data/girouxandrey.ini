[explanation]
ref = "(p.623, French et al., 2011)"
text = "Giroux and Rey (2009) showed that sublexical units (which we call subchunks) found within words become more difficult to identify once they have been combined into a larger chunk. They compared the recognition of the subchunks making up a word early in learning and late in learning of the word. They found that recognition performance for subchunks incorporated into larger chunks decreased as learning proceeded. We simulated Giroux & Rey as follows. We created a familiarization sequence made up of two-, three- and four-syllable words. We then exposed TRACX to this sequence, repeated 30 times. We tested how well various subchunks making up the word were recognized by the network at various points during learning."
