[explanation]
ref = "(p.622, French et al., 2011)"
text = "In Saffran et al.â€™s (1996) familiarization sequence, in addition to higher TPs for words than for partwords, words were heard 3 times as often as their associated partwords. Aslin et al. (1998) developed an experimental design that removed these frequency effects. They used four trisyllabic words, two of which were low- frequency words and two of which were high-frequency words, the latter occurring twice as often as the former in the familiarization sequence. This meant that the partwords spanning the boundary between the two high-frequency words, which we call HH- partwords, would have the same frequency in the familiarization language as the low-frequency words"
