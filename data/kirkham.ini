[explanation]
ref = "(p.B38, Kirkham, Slemmer &amp; Johnson., 2002)"
text = ". Stimuli consisted of six colored shapes (turquoise square, blue cross, yellow circle, pink diamond, green triangle, and red octagon) presented one at a time in a continuous stream, with no break or delay between shapes... The stimuli appeared in a continuous stream of randomly-ordered pairs (e.g. pair 1: turquoise square followed by blue cross; pair 2: yellow circle followed by pink diamond; pair 3: green triangle followed by red octagon; see Fig. 1), with only transitional probabilities defining between-stimulus boundaries (the transitional probability within pairs was 1.0 and between pairs it was 0.33). Shape pairing was randomized by the computer for each infant. The initial member of a shape pair always predicted the next member, and the next stimulus after a pair was constrained to be the initial member of one of the three allowable pairs."
