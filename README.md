This is a small help file explaining how to get started using the TRACX online simulator code.


Requirements:
=============

TRACX utilises several Javascript libraries. Pre-compiled versions are included in the /lib/ folder

JQuery 1.4.2 or greater:
http://jquery.com/

JQPlot 1.0.0b2 or greater:
http://www.jqplot.com/

Sylvester 0.1.3 or greater
http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/



Optional:
=========

http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/
                      



1. Simulator Only
==================
If you just wish to use the simulator, you can try it online at:
http://leadserv.u-bourgogne.fr/~tracx/


2. Local debugging
==================

If you just wish to use the simulator _and_ step through the code. You can use the current live code from:
http://leadserv.u-bourgogne.fr/~tracx/

Together with an in browser debug engine. We recommend Firebug:
https://getfirebug.com/

We have a beginners guide to debugging available at:
http://leadserv.u-bourgogne.fr/~tracx/debughelp.html


3. Adapting and modifying the TRACX code yourself
=================================================

This code is open source and freely available for you to use in your own projects. Just download the code and away you go. We recommend the Aptana Development environment.

Aptana :
http://aptana.org/

Within Aptana you can get started quickly by choosing the File/Import.. menu. Project type is __git__ and the repository URI is:

99% of the code is client-side javascript so will work locally. If you want to get the php working (to load up default datasets) we recommend

XAMMP:
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

That's it.
